This project is mainly an implementation of a recent result by Bj√∂rklund, Kaski, and Kowalik [0].

The following has been implemented:
* Nice tree decompositions, based on join trees in dlib
* Diaz's algorithm for counting list-colorings (including stingy orderings etc)
* Fomin's result for counting injective homomorphisms extending some existing
* Pattern graph partitioning with different acceptance critieria
* Simple and basic equations generating a linear equation system
* Solving of linear equation systems based on LU-decomposition in boost
* Naive methods of counting homomorphisms, injective homomorphisms, and aggregating triples

The included main file simply executes the test suite, which covers all of the implemented functionality.
